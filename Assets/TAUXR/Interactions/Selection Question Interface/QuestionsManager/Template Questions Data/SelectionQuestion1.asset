  Text: Based on this and your previous answers, what is the most probable mechanism,
    through which the Glu to Val mutation interferes with the biological activity
    of hemoglobin?
  Answers:
  - Text: Clashing of Val with other amino acids, causing the protein to unfold
    IsCorrect: 0
    AnswerInfo: impossible, since the amino acid is fully exposed
  - Text: Inducing long-range conformational changes that decrease the affinity of
      the heme to oxygen.
    IsCorrect: 0
    AnswerInfo: "unlikely, because Glu6\u2019s side chain does not form any interactions
      with other amino acids"
  - Text: Since Glu6 is exposed, far from the heme group, and points away from the
      protein, it probably acts through interactions with another molecule.
    IsCorrect: 1
